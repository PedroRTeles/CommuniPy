# PyPractice :snake: :books:
This repository includes exercises for refreshing Python skills, from strings, lists to Object Oriented Programming.

* **This is intended to be a place for everyone with any Python knowledge to contribute
and make an impact within the community. Have a problem in mind ? Make a pull request!**

**See [Notes](#notes) as to why test cases may be commented out.**

## How it works:
PyPractice is a place to craft your Python skills and validate them with Unit testing.
* Implementation happens in the source file (strings.py) within each Folder (e.g. 'Strings).
* After that, all you have to do is execute the test file. These have 'test_' at beginning of them.
* If you pass all tests no error will be thrown.
* If error is thrown it will trace back to the exact implementation where the error is coming from.
